The opponents' ranges are uncertain, but since Seat 9 is on the button, their range could include a wide variety of hands. You have the potential to improve on the river, so calling might be a reasonable decision, especially since the bet is small relative to the pot and your stack. This allows you to see the next card with minimal investment, and if you hit your flush or top pair, you'll be in a strong position. \n\n[call, N/A]\n\"\n\nAssistant:"
