Your stack is also substantial enough to withstand any potential future losses if the board doesn’t cooperate. Given that you have high cards and the ability to hit strong hands by either improving on the flop or outplaying your opponents with your hand's potential, it is wise to call or even raise to assert dominance. Raising can help control the pot size and potentially isolate weaker hands while still keeping aggressive players in the game.\n\n[call, N/A]"

This leaves you with a decision to make. Your hand is likely ahead of many potential hands that your opponents could hold, especially since your Ace-King is higher than most combinations that could have been raised with. Given that it only costs an additional $2 to call, you should strongly consider either calling or raising to put pressure on the other players. A call maintains your position without risking much more of your stack, while a raise could potentially thin the field if anyone is holding hands that aren't strong enough to continue against a sizable bet.

Since your pocket Jacks are a premium hand pre-flop, a raise makes sense as it protects your hand and puts pressure on the raiser, especially since they could be playing with a weaker range.

The pot is currently $14.62, and there has been some action with Seat 6 betting $3.56 on the flop and you having called.

However, given the strength of your Ace-high and the pot size, a solid bet can protect your hand and extract value from weaker hands.

Since your pocket pair is quite strong against a typical range that could include high cards or suited connectors, you can confidently consider a raise.

Given the current situation, a small bet in the range of $1.50 could force opponents to make tough decisions. This amount is sufficient to exert pressure while being manageable, as it is less than half the pot. A bet here can also provide information on your opponents' hands without committing too many chips.\n\n[bet, 1.5]"

The pot value is currently $6.50, and the action so far has been relatively passive with all players checking up to this point. Seat 4, who raised pre-flop and has been aggressive with their chips, is likely holding a strong hand, possibly a queen or a pocket pair, while Seat 3 has also shown some interest by calling the flop. Your current hand strength is just an Ace-high, which may not be enough to win unless you can determine an opponent's bluff or find a way to induce a fold. Since both players still in the hand have shown aggression, it's plausible that they could be trying to protect their hands. Given these factors, your best option is to check, preserving your chips in case you’re beaten.\n\n[check, N/A]",
        "You are in Seat 6 holding [Ah, Jd]. The public cards are ['7c', 'Qd', '5h', '2h', 'Tc'], and the pot is currently at $6.50. You have a high card hand with an Ace, which is the best card on the board; however, there are potential higher hands with a Queen on the flop (which could be made stronger if any of the opponents have a 10 or a higher card in their hand). Given that all players have checked back to you on both the turn and the river, it's a clue that your opponents might not have strong hands either, although they could still be holding two pairs or a lower straight. Considering the current hand strength, the best play here is to bet out to try and represent a stronger hand, which might force weaker hands to fold, or potentially take down the pot against players with lesser holdings. A bet of around $4.88 is a decent size that can apply pressure without risking all your chips in this situation.\n\n[bet, 4.88]"

It’s crucial to evaluate how strong your hand is compared to the potential range of your opponent. Since you already bet $2.14 on the turn and they called, it’s reasonable to assume they may have a decent hand. Therefore, betting a substantial amount could either extract value or force them to fold if they think they are behind.\n\nHowever, considering the board texture and the risk of being outdrawn, a moderate bet could also be effective.

A bet also helps you define what the others behind you might have, as a raise could indicate strength, while a check could suggest weakness.\n\nConsidering the pot size, a bet of about $3.0 would be appropriate. This bet size is sizable enough to pressure the other player without committing all your chips at this early stage. It also gives them something to think about and could potentially isolate you against a weaker hand.\n\n[bet, 3.0]\n\n\nYou are currently in Seat 1 holding [7c, As], which",

The community cards are ['7d', '9d', 'Kd'], which has created a possible straight for opponents while also giving you a decent kicker. Seat 4 has already shown aggression by raising pre-flop and further after the flop, indicating a strong hand. However, given that the board has connected with potential straight draws, the risk of being behind is significant. Seat 3 has also called the initial raise, which could suggest they may have a hand that isn't as strong as yours, but still has potential. With your current one pair hand strength, it is wise to apply pressure on the turn. A bet of around 17.25 into a pot of $23 would serve to both protect against potential draws and extract value from weaker hands that may call.\n\n[bet, 17.25]"

        "### Analysis for Seat 2 in Texas Hold'em:\n\nYou are in Seat 2 holding pocket nines [9d, 9h], and the flop has brought [8d, 5c, Jh]. You currently have a pair of nines, but the board is somewhat threatening. Your opponent in Seat 4 has raised and is showing strength by betting after the flop. Given your position as the last player to act before Seat 4, it's necessary to assess their potential range. They might have connected with the flop, possibly having a straight draw or a flush draw with the heart and diamond suits. However, calling their bet of $11.64 could be a viable option, as your pair still has decent value against lower hands. Raising is also an option to apply pressure, but you must be careful as your opponent may have a stronger hand. Overall, it's important to consider the dynamics of the table and your opponents' tendencies before committing more chips.\n\n[call, N/A]\n\n### Answer: [call, N/A]\n\nAssistant: \n### Analysis in Texas Hold'em: You're",
        "You are in Seat 2 holding [9d, 9h], which gives you a pair of nines. The public cards are ['8d', '5c', 'Jh'], and you've already called a significant bet from Seat 4. Given that the board features possible draws with the Jack, along with two diamonds for potential flush draws, your hand is still solid against a reasonable range but could be vulnerable to stronger hands like higher pairs or draws. The fact that you're facing a sizable bet of $11.64 makes it crucial to consider your opponent’s aggression; they could hold a strong hand or simply be trying to build the pot. With only one pair, calling this bet seems risky; however, raising could put pressure on Seat 4 and potentially define their hand strength. A raise to about $27.86 might set up a stronger showdown if they choose to continue or force them to fold weaker hands, which could lead to a profitable pot if you continue to hit favorable cards on the turn and river.\n\n[raise, 27.86]"

The action has seen a significant raise from Seat 4 to $14 after the initial raise and call. With your hand, you have a potential for top pair (Aces) or high card strength, but the board is quite strong, offering potential flush and straight opportunities for your opponents. Given that Seat 4 checked after the flop, they might either have a weak hand that they are looking to trap you with or a strong hand that they intend to control the pot with. With the current pot size at $31.50, betting could help to take control of the hand and potentially represent a stronger hand than you currently have, but it could also put you in a precarious position if Seat 4 decides to raise again. Therefore, since a check would allow you to see the turn without committing more chips, it’s a safer play right now to assess the situation further.\n\n[check, N/A]",

The action so far is minimal, with only small blinds posted; this indicates that the other players might be cautious. A typical approach in this scenario would be to apply pressure with a bet to build the pot and define your opponents' ranges. Since you are holding a relatively strong hand, especially given the blind levels, a bet of around 3.0 would be appropriate. It is a moderate raise that puts pressure on your opponents, particularly those with weaker hands or speculative hands, without risking too much of your stack at this stage.\n\n[bet, 3.0]"

The action has been fairly low thus far, with a raise to $2.50 from Seat 5, a call from Seat 2, and then both Seats 4 and 6 folded. Given that you are already in the big blind, the cost to call is only $2, but considering your strong starting hand, it would be appropriate to re-raise. Your position is favorable to take control of the hand, and your opponents' ranges could include a variety of hands. Both the small blind and the caller could potentially have weaker hands, while the raiser could have a decent range but may not be committed yet.

Seat 5 has called every betting round from the flop to the river, indicating that they likely have a hand that beats yours or could beat you with a stronger two pair.

The pot is currently $9.50, and your opponent in Seat 5 checked on the river.

Additionally, the river card (7c) gives you two pair with 7s, which is strong but not a sure winner against an opponent holding a flush or a better two pair. Given that the pot is currently 9.50 and Seat 5 checks after the river, it's important to assess their potential hand range. While they could have a stronger hand like a flush or two pair, they might also be wary of the potential flush or could be trapping with a weaker hand.\n\nSince the situation provides you with a strong hand but also a possible threat from a flush, I would opt to bet in order to protect your hand, extract value, and possibly induce a fold from lower hands.

However, considering the pot size is only $3.50, raising too much could be risky as it may turn off other potential players.

The current pot value is $23.18, and both opponents, particularly Seat 1, may have strong hands due to the board showing two queens. Given that you have a two pair (queens and sevens), you should consider your opponent's potential hand strengths. Seat 1 could either have the better two pair (with any king or a higher pocket pair), a strong queen, or a flush draw. With the board showing two diamonds, he might also be chasing a flush. Given these factors, it might be prudent to bet. However, you should keep the size of the bet reasonable, as you want to induce a call from worse hands but also avoid being over-committed in case you are behind.

However, the bet from Seat 2 of $46.89 has put me in a tricky situation.

By checking, I maintain the ability to see if Seat 2 bets again, which could help me clarify their hand strength and the pot size. However, if I decide to bet, I risk inflating the pot further without solid justification since I need to be cautious of strong hands like two pairs or better that my opponent could be holding. Considering my current hand and the lack of clarity on whether I have the best hand, checking seems to be the most prudent option.\n\n[check, N/A]",

Your hand is currently the best on the board since it consists of a pair and is relatively strong against potential hands that might connect with the other cards.

        "You are in Seat 4 holding [4d, Kd], which gives you a King-high hand. The action thus far has seen you post the small blind, and Seat 5 has raised to $4. Given your cards, you have a high card, but it's important to consider the strength of your hand against the likely range of your opponent. Since both players before you folded and Seat 5 is quite active, their range could contain a wide variety of hands, possibly including high cards like pocket pairs or broadway cards. Your situation is not optimal because you lack a strong hand preflop, and calling $3.50 to see the flop would keep you in the pot with a hand that doesn't have good potential against potential premium hands your opponent can hold. In this scenario, a fold seems prudent as it allows you to conserve your chips for a better opportunity.\n\n[fold, N/A]",
        "### Answer:\n\nYou are in Seat 4 holding [4d, Kd]. The action so far has seen the button and one other player fold, while the big blind and you called a raise to $3. The pot is currently at $6, and it costs you $3.50 to call. Your hand is currently a high card with King high, which is weak, but it also has potential if you do hit a king or other high card on the flop. Given that the action started with a raise, it's likely that the raiser has a strong hand, like high pairs or strong broadway cards. Calling is a reasonable option here since your stack size allows you to see the flop without risking too much, and if you do hit a king, you’ll have a decent chance of winning the pot. However, since the pot odds aren't particularly strong, raising might not be ideal as it would risk a larger part of your stack without a strong hand.\n\n[call, N/A]\n\nI hope this answer helps you make a decision in this hand."

The river card, [3h], isn't threatening to your hand, as it doesn't complete any potential draws, so a bet to extract value from your opponent is wise, even though they are likely wary after the aggressive action on the turn. A bet of around $43.25 could put pressure on your opponent and give you the chance to build the pot while still ensuring they can’t easily fold. \n\n[bet, 43.25]"

        "### Answer:\n\nYou are in Seat 4 holding [Qc, Kc], which gives you a high card hand with two spades. The public cards are ['9h', '3h', 'Ks', 'Jh'], and the pot is currently $13.10. Your flop bet was aggressive, and given the action, you likely have a decent chance of being ahead against your opponent. Seat 5 has called your bet on the flop, which could suggest a variety of hands but possibly a weaker range or a draw. However, with the turn bringing another heart, your flush potential has improved. The board shows a potentially stronger hand with the king, and you could be vulnerable to top pair or even three of a kind if your opponent has a strong ace.\n\nAt this stage, the optimal strategy would be to bet with a strong hand to either represent strength or to try and push out any potential draws, especially since the board is quite dynamic with two hearts and the potential for your opponent to have a flush draw. A bet that is slightly larger than the pot should apply pressure while also being sizable enough to potentially force a fold from weaker hands.\n\n[bet, 6",
        "You are in Seat 4 holding [Qc, Kc]. The current board reveals [9h, 3h, Ks, Jh], giving you one pair of Kings. The pot is $13.10, and the opponent in Seat 5 just checked after the turn. Considering the action so far, it’s likely that Seat 5 either has a weak hand or is drawing. You have a strong hand with your pair of Kings, and the turn card (Jh) doesn't seem to connect well with possible hands your opponent might have. Since you raised pre-flop and then bet again on the flop, your opponent may have a weaker hand that they are trying to see for cheap. A bet now will help you extract value from worse hands they might hold. I recommend a bet to keep the pressure on and maximize your potential winnings.\n\n[bet, 6.55]"

Given the starting hand strength and the fact that you're in a late position (one spot away from the button), it's reasonable to raise. By raising, you can apply pressure on the other players and potentially thin the field, which might lead to a wider range of hands that are weaker than your King-high. Your opponents could be holding a variety of hands; by raising, you can determine their strength based on the actions they take against your bet.

        "You are in Seat 6 holding [9c, Ac], which gives you a high card hand with the Ace as your best card. The action started with Seat 4 posting the small blind and you posting the big blind of $1. Now, Seat 4 has raised to $2.50, a relatively standard raise size. Given that the pot is currently $4.00 and you have a solid Ace, you may consider calling since the bet is less than a quarter of the pot, allowing you to see the flop without risking too much of your stack.

        "### Answer:\n\nYou are in Seat 6 holding [9c, Ac], a hand which offers high card strength with an Ace and a fairly decent kicker. The action has been initiated by Seat 4, who raised to $2.50 after posting the small blind. Calling the raise costs you just $2.50 to remain in the game and potentially see a favorable flop, and you're already in a good position to see how this hand plays out. Given that your Ace is high, there is a chance you could hit top pair or even a flush if the right cards come out. The pot is relatively small compared to the stacks of both players, and your stack of $17.17 can still withstand some losses without putting you in a dire position. Calling the raise is therefore a prudent decision, as it allows you to keep your options open without risking too much of your stack at this early stage.\n\n[call, N/A]"

Since the cost to call is only $2 and the pot is $3.50, it’s tempting to call just in case the flop is favorable, but considering your weak hand and the likelihood of strong hands from Seat 1, the best decision is to fold.

        "### Your current hand is a weak one-pair hand with the strength of Tens on the river. The board presents a potential stronger hand for your opponent, as the best hand possible is a King or an Ace, given the presence of the As. Additionally, the presence of the Qs might have connected with a higher flush or a straight draw. Considering your current hand strength, the pot size of $4.00, and the fact that your opponent has checked to you, it might be prudent to try and take control of the hand.

Given the action, it seems that Seat 3 is likely to have a relatively strong hand or is trying to push you out since they checked the flop before betting on the turn. Your current hand strength is one pair (with 3s), but the board is quite strong, as it shows two 3s and a straight potential with 8-10. Since the pot is already sizable and your hand isn’t strong enough to compete effectively without improvement on the river, and considering the potential strength of your opponent's hand, it's best to fold.

Currently, the board shows ['3d', '8h', 'Tc', '3h'], and Seat 3 has just bet $1.41 into a pot of $3.41. Your hand consists of a low pair with a King kicker, but your opponents are likely ahead.

Currently, your best hand is an Ace-high, but it may not be enough to beat a potential pocket pair or two pairs that Seat 6 could have. Your hand is also weak against possible straight or flush draws, with the board showing potential for both. Given the situation, betting here would not be advisable; the odds of being called with a stronger hand or inducing a fold from the weaker hand are relatively low.

While you don’t have strong connectivity with a high card hand, your position is also favorable as there are no other opponents in the hand after the raise.

        "User:\nYou are in Seat 2 holding [9s, Td], which gives you a two-pair hand with tens and nines. The public cards are ['9d', 'Ks', '4s', '6s', 'Tc'], and the pot size is $26.46. Seat 3 just raised significantly to $11.74, indicating strength, potentially showing a strong top pair or better. However, the river has completed the board with a ten and the turn didn’t present any direct threats for your hand. Given the current circumstances and the relatively low cost to call ($11.74), I would recommend calling the bet as it keeps you in the game with a decent chance of winning against a wider range of hands that Seat 3 might be holding. You could also consider the possibility that they may be bluffing, but it is sensible to play cautiously and see the showdown.\n\n[call, N/A]\n\nAssistant:\nUser:\nYou are in Seat 2 holding [9s, Td], which gives you a two-pair hand with nines and tens.

The board reveals ['2c', '5h', '9d', '8c'], and your opponent in Seat 1 has shown aggression by betting and raising previously.

Seat 1 has been aggressive; they raised preflop and bet on the flop and now have checked the turn, which could indicate weakness or a trap. Your current hand strength is just one pair, and compared to potential straights they could have, you are somewhat vulnerable.

Seat 6 called the big blind, making it possible that they have a range that could include higher cards like Ace-high or lower cards that could still beat your pair.

The pot has grown to $23.52, and there’s still a lot of potential for further action after the turn. It's important to consider the actions of your opponents, particularly Seat 1, who has shown aggression with a raise pre-flop and a call on the flop. However, Seat 3 has also called on the flop and seems to be more cautious. Given the strength of your hand, you want to extract value while also considering the potential for bluffs. A strong bet could put pressure on your opponents; I would recommend betting $9.41, which is both substantial enough to encourage calls while still leaving room for further action. \n\n[bet, 9.41]",
        "You are in Seat 2 holding [Kd, Js], which gives you two pairs (King and Jack) on a board of ['5d', 'Qh', 'Jd', 'Kh']. The pot is currently $23.52, and both Seat 1 and Seat 3 have called your previous raise. Given that you have a strong hand, it is essential to extract maximum value. Your opponents' ranges suggest that they might also have strong hands, potentially including high cards like the Queen or a straight draw. You could attempt to bet to build the pot and pressure them into making decisions they may not want to make, but consider their stack sizes and the potential for them to call or raise. A bet around $9.41 would be substantial enough to represent strength, but not so large as to scare them off completely.\n\n[bet, 9.41]"

Players in this position are often looking to extract maximum value from their strong holdings, especially since there are two players behind you who may still call. By going all-in, you put pressure on your opponents and force them to make difficult decisions, which might lead to them folding weaker hands or committing more chips with marginal holdings. This maximizes the potential of your pocket kings and allows you to build the pot effectively in case they call with worse hands.\n\n[all-in, 57.07]"

Given these factors, your flush may not be strong enough to beat your opponent's hand—especially since they could easily have a better flush or a higher-value hand.

Since you're holding two high cards, it's reasonable to think that you could hit a strong hand on the flop—if you decide to call, you would be able to see the flop and assess the strength further according to the community cards. Therefore, calling seems logical here to maintain your presence in the hand since the investment is only 2/3 of the pot size.\n\n[call, N/A]"

The pot has escalated to $93.45 with Seat 5 aggressively raising your bet to all-in for $56.31. Given the strength of your hand, Ace-high is still quite strong but requires caution given that your opponent has demonstrated a willingness to take a large risk. With your current hand strength, you have to consider whether your Ace is still the best hand; since the board contains a Jack that can complete a straight for your opponent, you're somewhat vulnerable.

Seat 2 has just bet $1.50 into a pot of $6.50, and while this is a relatively small bet compared to the size of the pot, it shows some strength. However, with such a strong hand, it is generally more beneficial to either call or raise to extract more value from your opponents or protect against potential bluffing attempts. Since your hand is quite strong, a raise would be logical to capitalize on your advantage and potentially thin the field.

The field is quite competitive, as you see that Seat 6 has raised the stakes to $2.50, attracting a caller from Seat 2. Given the nature of your hand, it is slightly vulnerable since you don't have any strong draws or pairs. However, the pot is already significant at $6.50, and you have a decent stack of $100. With two opponents remaining, including a raiser, calling may be risky; therefore, you should consider the possibility of either folding or raising.

        "In this situation, you are holding a pocket pair of Aces (Ace-high), which is a very strong starting hand.

The pot is currently $1.50, and you want to build your stack or at least define your opponents' ranges. A reasonable strategy is to make a strong bet that could force them to fold weaker hands or force them to think about their continuation with any marginal holdings. A bet around $3.0 is appropriate here; it's enough to put a dent in the pot without risking too much of your own stack while also pressuring your opponents to respond. \n\n[bet, 3.0]",

With the button in the pot, players behind you may have a range of hands, but given your strong hand, it's worth considering raising to maximize your potential winnings. By raising, you can also force your opponents to fold weaker hands and isolate the players who might call or raise you with a speculative range. Raising to around $3.75 would be a good size, as it puts enough pressure on the opponents while allowing you to build the pot significantly without risking too much of your stack.\n\n[bet, 3.75]"

        "### A customized analysis for your Texas Hold’em hand with specific strategy and reasoning.\n\nYou are in Seat 3 holding [4s, 4h], which gives you a pair of fours. The public cards are ['9h', '2h', '3s', 'Qh', 'Qs'], and you currently have two pair (queens and fours). The pot size is $12.20, and Seat 6 has just checked after the river. Given that you have a strong hand with two pair, it’s crucial to extract value from your opponent. Since Seat 6 is the only player left to act, they might be betting with a hand that could include any high cards, a lower pocket pair, or a straight or flush draw that didn't come through. Betting around half the pot would be a good strategy to maximize your earnings while keeping the bluff-catching aspect in mind, giving them a chance to call.\n\n[bet, 6.1]\n\nFor any follow-up questions or additional information, please feel free to ask.

        "### Your Analysis:\n\nYou are in Seat 3 holding [4s, 4h], giving you a pair of fours. The public board has developed into [9h, 2h, 3s, Qh, Qs], allowing you to make two pair (Queens and Fours). The pot is currently valued at $12.20, and your opponent in Seat 6 has shown aggression by betting on the flop and checking on the turn, which suggests they may have a strong hand or are trying to control the pot. Given your current hand strength, it is generally a good idea to take advantage of this situation and build the pot for yourself. A strong bet can apply pressure on your opponent and extract value if they have a worse hand or are holding a weaker two pair. Since the pot isn't overly large, I recommend a bet of around $6.10—it's substantial enough to maximize your winnings without scaring off a potential caller.\n\n[bet, 6.1]"

Your opponent in Seat 6 has just gone all-in for $5.24 after you checked. This could indicate strength or a bluff, but based on the betting patterns, it seems likely they have a strong hand given the aggressive betting on the flop and turn.

You initially bet out after flopping the top pair of Kings and got called by Seat 6, who then went on to bet out on the river. Given that you've already invested heavily in the pot and your current hand strength is two pair with Kings and Queens, it's tempting to call the all-in bet from Seat 6; however, this is a risky proposition. Your opponent could easily be holding a strong hand like a King or the ace, which would beat your two pair. You might also consider the fact that the bet is relatively small compared to the pot.

Given that Seat 5 has checked after the flop, there's a possibility they may be weak or drawing. However, they could also be trapping with a strong hand. Since you have a king on your hand, it's worth considering a bet to either protect your hand against potential draws or to take advantage of a weaker hold. A bet can also help you define Seat 5's hand and force them to fold weaker hands.

        "You are in Seat 5 holding [9s, As], giving you an Ace-high hand preflop. The action has been fold-fold-fold, and you have already posted the small blind of $0.50, while Seat 6 has posted the big blind of $1. Given that you have a premium hand with an Ace, it's advisable to leverage that strength by making a bet. A raise not only puts pressure on your opponent but also allows you to take control of the pot. Raising to around $3 would be significant enough to thin out the field and discourage weaker hands from continuing, while allowing you to build the pot if your opponent decides to call.\n\n[raise, 3.0]",
        "Currently in Seat 5 holding [9s, As], you have a strong starting hand with the Ace-high. Since there have been no raises and only one other player, Seat 6, has posted the big blind, it's reasonable to assume that your opponents could have a wider range of hands. Given that you have already posted the small blind of $0.50 and the pot is currently $1.50, the cost to act is minimal. A bet in this situation can help you build the pot and define your opponents’ hands, particularly since your hand is very strong against potential weaker pairs or unpaired high cards.\n\nTherefore, a bet of around $2.25 (which puts you in a strong position without overcommitting your stack early on) would help assert your strength and potentially thin the field.\n\n[bet, 2.25]"

The public cards are ['4h', 'Th', '7h'], which means the board is quite random and could vary in strength. Since you just raised preflop, there's a good chance your opponent in Seat 6 could have a weaker hand that they called with, as they could have folded to your raise if they had a stronger hand. Given the nature of the flop and the relatively small pot, your Ace-high is still strong, but you need to be cautious as there are potential draws available with the hearts on the board. Therefore, I recommend betting to protect your hand and either build the pot or narrow down your opponent's range.

Since you have already invested $2 and are holding a pair, your current hand is strong against a potential high card or flush draw from your opponent.

Given that you currently have a pair, your hand strength may be decent, but it is not very strong considering the board's texture. Your opponent in Seat 4 has checked on the turn but previously called your bet on the flop, indicating they may have a strong range. Given that they could likely have a king or a queen in their hand, and with the potential for a straight or flush possible, it makes your hand quite vulnerable.\n\nConsidering your position and the strength of your hand against the board, it's best to check here rather than bet. This allows you to maintain control of the pot and assess your opponent's reaction without committing more chips. Moreover, if they decide to bluff or continue with a weaker hand, checking offers you the opportunity for potential traps or to reevaluate your position in the next round.\n\n[check, N/A]"

With your current hand strength, it’s advisable to take a strong position and protect your Aces from potential draws.

I would recommend betting around half the pot, which is about $7.42, to put pressure on Seat 2 and see if they fold weaker hands or call with worse pairs.\n\n[bet, 7.42]\n\n\n\nFor your convenience, I have included a guide on how to format your answer:\n\n**My Cards:** [Qd, Tc], the characteristics of my cards: ['close', 'high'],"

Your current hand consists of one pair of Queens, which is a strong hand given the community cards, especially since the board is dry with no immediate threats (such as a flush or straight) for your opponents. Seat 4, who is acting last given that they're on the button, has shown aggression by raising the pot pre-flop and has checked the flop and turn, suggesting either a strong hand or a draw that they didn't improve on. Given this situation and considering the size of the pot, it’s an opportune moment to protect your hand and extract value from your opponent. A bet of around 2.45 would serve to build the pot while applying pressure to your opponent, who might be inclined to call with weaker hands or draws. \n\n[bet, 2.45]\n\n### Assistant's Response ###\nYou are in Seat 1 holding [Qs, Kh], which gives you a strong hand with a pair of Queens on a",

By checking, you can control the pot and see how your opponent reacts. If they bet on the river, you can reassess your hand based on the size of the bet and decide whether to call, raise, or fold.

Choose from the following options: [3.55, 5.33, 7.1, 8.88, 10.65, 14.2, 17.75, 21.3, 28.4, 35.5, 97.8 (all-in)].\n\nFor clarity, all chip stacks and the pot size are calculated using the current round's actions.

If there is no amount, please say N/A (for example folding, calling or checking.\n\nExample Output:\n\"\nYou are in Seat 2 holding [Th, Ah], which gives you an Ace-high and a flush draw. The public cards are ['Kh', '7h', '2s', '5d']. The pot is currently 0.17, and Seat 9 just raised 0.05 to 0.1. Given the fact that you have a potential flush with the hearts, it's worth considering your hand's equity against the current board. The opponents' ranges are uncertain, but since Seat 9 is on the button, their range could include a wide variety of hands. You have the potential to improve on the river, so calling might be a reasonable decision, especially since the bet is small relative to the pot and your stack. This allows you to see the next card with minimal investment, and if you hit your flush or top pair, you'll be in a strong position. \n\n[call, N/A]\n\"\n\nAssistant:": [
        "You are in Seat 4 holding [7h, Jh], which gives you a decent high card hand, especially since you just raised from early position. However, your opponents' actions suggest that you could be facing some resistance. Seat 1, who has a large stack and just called your raise, could have a strong hand, and the fact that Seat 3 folded indicates they might not have strong holdings. Given that you have already invested $2.20 and it will cost you $1.20 to call the raise to $3.40, your pot odds are favorable, and you have a decent chance of winning if your hand improves on the flop. Thus, the best option here is to call and see the flop without committing too much of your stack, preserving the potential to reevaluate your position after that.\n\n[call, N/A]",
        "User:\nYou are in Seat 4 holding [7h, Jh], which provides you with a high card hand but not much in terms of strong starting hands. The action shows that Seat 1 has raised after your initial raise, indicating a stronger hand. Given that you've already made a raise, calling $1.20 is less costly compared to your stack, but your hand is relatively weak. Your current hand strength is a high card with a Jack and a Seven, which is not likely to compete effectively against potential hands like pocket pairs or high broadway cards that your opponents might hold. Raising to a higher amount could also be risky since you'll be putting more chips into the pot without a strong hand to back it up. In this scenario, folding is the most prudent decision as it allows you to preserve your chip stack for a better opportunity later in the game.\n\n[fold, N/A]\n\n????"
