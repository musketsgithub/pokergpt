Since Seat 2 has shown a willingness to continue betting large sums, they may have a stronger hand potentially holding trips or a straight. A bet here could either force them to fold if they are drawing or incentivize a call or raise that could extend the pot further while risking your current hand strength against that of your opponent.

Given the current board is blank with no public cards revealed, and the pot is small at $2.00, you need to consider your options carefully. Raising here would not make much sense, as the hand strength is weak and unlikely to improve on most post-flop cards.
